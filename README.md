## What is RoonixJS?

RoonixJS is a new way to build web applications. It's a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

Learn more at the [RoonixJS website](https://RoonixJS.dev), or stop by the [Discord chatroom](https://RoonixJS.dev/chat).

## Getting started

You can play around with RoonixJS in the [tutorial](https://learn.RoonixJS.dev/), [examples](https://RoonixJS.dev/examples), and [REPL](https://RoonixJS.dev/repl).

When you're ready to build a full-fledged application, we recommend using [RoonixJSKit](https://kit.RoonixJS.dev):

```bash
npm create RoonixJS@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [the RoonixJSKit documentation](https://kit.RoonixJS.dev/docs) to learn more.
